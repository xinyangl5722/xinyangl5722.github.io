            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>During this project, I had to make a movie webpage about an original movie from my own imagination. I had to work with a partner to make this project. The name of the movie is "Xing Yi".</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The movie is about a girl called Xing Yi that has travelled to another universe by accident and met her other self which we call her "Yi". She learned sword fighting, kiled the monsters with Yi, and recieving a device that allows her to travel between Yi's universe and her own.</p>
            <p>Me and my partner distributed the roles on what we had to do in order to finish this webpage. We used h1 and h2 elements, paragraph (p) elements, divs and spans, imputs and submits, lists, elements, class, id, and other CSS elements. Plus, we also made a sequel for the movie.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Overall, one challenge we both had was to figure out how to link the two movies (original and sequel) together. When we used the (a href) code and then put the link, the webpage didn't connect. We didn't really know how to make the two webpages connect. Then later, I found out that I have to click the "new tab" button on the page. Then, I found the link of the webpage and then applied it to our (a href) link. Another challenge was that there were many errors on our webpage. We worked together and communicated step-by-step to debug the code.</p>
            <p>My biggest takeaway is communication is key. We both learned how to collaborate in order to fix errors step-by-step and being patient with each other.</p>
            <p>In the future, I am hoping to gain more knowledge about coding and websites to make them more advanced.</p>
